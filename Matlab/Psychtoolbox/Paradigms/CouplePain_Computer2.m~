%% Notes

% This paradigm allows a partner to rate how much distress they are feeling
% in response to their partner experiencing pain.  They are asked to rate
% how much pain they feel after ever trial.
%
% Biopac triggering will happen on computer 1 via the parallel port

% Conditions
% 1) Pain with partner not in room
% 2) Pain with parter in room but hidden
% 3) pain with partner in room - can see and not talk
% 4) pain with partner in room and press button after each pain (message sharing control)
% 5) pain with partner can share how feeling
% 6) pain with partner can talk only distraction
% 7) pain with partner can provide support
% 8) pain with partner holding hand
% 9) Pain with partner not in room
